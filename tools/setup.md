# Low-Code AI Prototype Tool Setup

This guide provides general steps to set up a Python-based low-code AI prototype tool. **Please replace these instructions with the specific setup steps for your actual tool.**

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.8+:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Access to your system's terminal or command prompt.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Tool's Repository (if applicable):**
    If your tool is hosted on GitHub or a similar platform, clone it:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-ai-tool.git
    cd your-ai-tool
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-org/your-ai-tool.git` with the actual repository URL and `your-ai-tool` with the correct directory name.)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the tool's root directory (where `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` is located) and install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # OR if using poetry/pipenv:
    # poetry install
    # pipenv install
    ```
    *(Replace `requirements.txt` with the correct dependency file if different.)*

5.  **Configure the Tool (if necessary):**
    Your tool might require specific configuration (e.g., API keys, database connections). Refer to the tool's documentation for details.
    *(Example: Create a `.env` file or modify a `config.py` file.)*

6.  **Run the Tool / Verify Installation:**
    Execute the command to start or test your tool. This might vary greatly depending on the tool.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    # OR
    # your_tool_command --version
    # your_tool_command start
    ```
    *(Replace `python app.py` with the actual command to run your tool.)*

## Troubleshooting

*   **`command not found`:** Ensure Python and Git are in your system's PATH.
*   **Dependency errors:** Make sure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.
*   **Tool-specific issues:** Consult the tool's official documentation or support channels.
