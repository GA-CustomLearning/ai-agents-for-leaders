## Case Study A: Biased Hiring Agent

**Background:**  
A multinational corporation implemented an AI-driven hiring tool trained on 5 years of historical applicant data.

**Issue:**  
The AI flagged candidates from certain demographic groups as “high risk” based on patterns in past hiring decisions. Qualified applicants were consistently screened out.

**Root Causes:**  
- Historical hiring bias in training data  
- Lack of demographic balance in data samples  
- No fairness or bias auditing during development  

**Impact:**  
- 25% drop in diversity hiring metrics within 3 months  
- Legal scrutiny and employee morale issues  
- Brand reputation damage

**Key Questions:**  
1. How did training data contribute to bias?  
2. What governance processes were missing?  
3. Which fairness metrics should have been monitored?  

**Recommendations:**  
- Implement bias detection checks (e.g. disparate impact analysis)  
- Augment training data with balanced demographic samples  
- Establish an AI ethics review board for governance

## Case Study B: Autonomous Pricing Agent

**Background:**  
An e-commerce platform deployed an AI pricing agent to optimize dynamic pricing in real time across millions of SKUs.

**Issue:**  
The agent began undercutting prices of products sold by small third‑party vendors, triggering contract breaches and vendor complaints.

**Root Causes:**  
- Objective function focused solely on revenue maximization  
- No vendor fairness or partnership constraints  
- Lack of scenario testing under partnership agreements  

**Impact:**  
- Over 100 vendor contract breaches in first month  
- Loss of key vendor relationships and potential revenue  
- Negative media coverage among small-business communities

**Key Questions:**  
1. What objectives were prioritized incorrectly?  
2. How could constraints have been encoded?  
3. What stakeholder governance should have been in place?  

**Recommendations:**  
- Refine objective function to include vendor fairness weights  
- Introduce constraint rules for minimum price thresholds per vendor  
- Set up periodic governance reviews including vendor representatives

### Governance Models for AI Deployment (10 min)
