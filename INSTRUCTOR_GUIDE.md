# Instructor Guide: Designing & Deploying Autonomous AI Agents

**Workshop Duration:** 2 hours
**Audience:** 100–150 C-suite executives and senior leaders with baseline AI literacy
**Repository:** [https://github.com/your-org/ai4-agentic-workshop](https://github.com/your-org/ai4-agentic-workshop)

## Learning Objectives

1. Articulate the strategic value of agentic AI across revenue, cost, and risk.
2. Prototype AI-driven recommendations for individual organizational challenges.
3. Develop a concise pilot plan with governance guardrails and success metrics.

## Materials & Setup

* Personal laptops with browser and AI tool access.
* Workshop materials accessed via browser or local clone (see Participant Guide for options).
* Individual metric mapping template open in `Resources/templates/metric-mapping.xlsx`.
* Projector for live demos (no whiteboarding).

## Workshop Flow & Facilitation Notes

*(All activities are individual to accommodate 100–150 participants; no team exercises or whiteboarding)*

### 0–30 min: Welcome & Community Discovery

* **Goal:** Build community, surface individual expectations, and capture prior AI experience.
* **Instructor Actions:**

  * Brief opening: objectives and agenda.
  * Invite each participant (or 10 volunteers via mic) to state “Why I’m here” and one prior AI activity they’ve tried.
  * Record top themes in a shared slide or digital board (live scribing by facilitator).

### 30–45 min: Framing Agentic AI for Impact

* **Goal:** Align on agentic AI basics and executive lenses.
* **Slides:** `slides/overview.pdf`.
* **Talking Points:**

  * Define agentic AI as systems that perceive, decide, and act autonomously fileciteturn3file0.
  * Present three executive priorities: grow revenue, optimize costs, mitigate risk.
* **Activity:** Participants select their priority in a poll tool (e.g., Slido).

### 45–90 min: Individual Lab: Apply AI to Your Priority

* **Goal:** Hands-on crafting of AI prompts with direct relevance.
* **Instructions:**

  1. Open `Resources/prompts/lab1.md`.
  2. Individually draft prompts in ChatGPT (or chosen AI tool) to generate **three actionable recommendations** for your selected priority.
  3. Map each recommendation to a specific metric in `Resources/templates/metric-mapping.xlsx`.
* **Facilitation:**

  * Circulate to answer questions and demo iterative prompting live on the projector.

### 90–95 min: Rapid Insight Share

* **Goal:** Highlight standout individual insights.
* **Process:**

  * Ask 3–5 volunteers to briefly share one recommendation and its expected impact metric (30 s each).

### 95–110 min: Refine & Pilot Planning

* **Goal:** Add governance guardrails and outline a mini-pilot.
* **Instructions:**

  1. Open `Resources/templates/governance-checklist.md`.
  2. Add compliance or human-in-the-loop notes to your prompt designs.
  3. Draft a 1-page pilot outline: scope, timeline (next 2 weeks), owner, and success metric.
* **Facilitation:**

  * Show a sample pilot plan on screen; encourage participants to mirror the format.

### 110–120 min: Commitments & Next Steps

* **Goal:** Ensure action post-workshop and ongoing community support.
* **Process:**

  * In poll tool, have participants submit one commitment (e.g. “I will test my AI prompt with my finance team by next Wednesday”).
  * Share resources: GitHub repo, Slack channel #ai4-leaders.
  * Thank participants and invite feedback via survey link.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

* If individuals struggle, demonstrate improving one prompt live.
* Use scribe to capture discussion themes—no whiteboarding.
* Maintain pace: reserve time checks at 30, 45, 90, and 110 minutes.

## Post-Workshop Follow-Up

* Collect pilot outlines via GitHub issues.
* Schedule optional office hours for prompt feedback and governance Q\&A.
