# Module 04: Refine & Plan Your Pilot

**Path:** `modules/04-refine-pilot/README.md`

### Purpose

Help leaders add governance guardrails to their prototypes and define a clear pilot plan for organizational integration.

### Learning Objectives

*   Introduce governance considerations (compliance, oversight).
*   Iterate prompts with guardrails and designated roles.
*   Draft a concise pilot plan with next steps and stakeholders.

### Materials

*   Governance checklist: `templates/governance-checklist.md`.
*   Pilot plan template: `plans/pilot-plan.md`.
*   Example pilot from past cohort.

### Instructions

**Governance Review (5 min)**

*   Present key items from the governance checklist.

**Prompt Refinement (10 min)**

*   Teams update their prompts to include guardrail instructions (tone, data source limits, privacy filters).

**Pilot Plan Draft (10 min)**

*   Use the pilot plan template to outline: scope, timeline, roles, success criteria.

**Commitment Capture (5 min)**

*   Each participant states their next step and adds it to the shared plan board.

### Quick Checklist Usage
1. **Display & Distribute:** Project or print the one-pager for all teams.  
2. **Team Self-Audit (5 min):** Tick ✔️/❌ each item against your draft plan.  
3. **Deep-Dive Discussion:** For ❌ items, assign ownership and next steps:
   - Who owns the PII plan?  
   - Who’s the human reviewer?  
   - When’s the bias audit scheduled?  
   - How is RBAC configured?  
   - Where will logs live & who reviews them?  
4. **Convert to Action Items:** Capture any gaps as tasks in your Pilot Plan.  
5. **Iterate & Embed:** Keep the checklist visible in GitHub or on your team board; revisit at each pilot milestone.

### Tips for Facilitator

*   Provide a strong example of a governance note in prompts.
*   Stress realistic timelines: pilot in next 1–2 weeks.
*   Collect plans via GitHub pull requests for follow-up.
