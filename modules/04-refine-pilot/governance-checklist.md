General Assembly’s AI Agent Governance One-Pager
Why Governance Matters
Effective governance ensures your AI agents are safe, ethical, and aligned to business goals—minimizing risk while maximizing impact.
Long-Term Context
• Governance as Your North Star: Treat this page as the living playbook for safety, ethics, and reliability—revisit it at every project milestone.
 • Onboarding New Team Members: Share this one-pager with any new collaborator to get them up to speed on your standards.
 • Audit & Compliance Checks: Use when preparing internal or external reviews—everything you need is here.

 Key Pillars & Why They Matter
 Data Privacy & Compliance
What: Secure PII, follow GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA, enforce retention policies. See NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF)
Why: Avoid fines, protect customer trust, and pave the way for future data-driven initiatives.
6-Month Check: Confirm data-handling SOPs are still enforced; update policy for any new regulations.
 Human-in-the-Loop
What: Defined review workflows, escalation paths, clear ownership. Based on principles from the Partnership on AI
Why: Balances speed with safety—people catch what AI can’t.
6-Month Check: Ensure roles haven’t drifted and that someone is still actively auditing outputs weekly.
⚖️ Bias & Fairness
What: Regular bias audits, fairness metrics, mitigation plans. Aligned with OECD’s AI Principles (OECD AI)
Why: Keeps your agents equitable and your brand reputationally safe.
6-Month Check: Run a new bias report on your latest data; adjust thresholds as your use cases evolve.
 Security & Access Control
What: Vaulted secrets, RBAC, API protection, network segmentation. See ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 guidelines (ISO SC42)
Why: Prevents breaches and unauthorized actions—critical as adoption scales.
6-Month Check: Rotate keys, review access logs, and audit user permissions.
 Auditability & Transparency
What: Comprehensive logs, version control of models/data, periodic reviews. Reflects EU’s “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI” (EU Guidelines)
Why: Enables root-cause analysis, supports compliance, and builds stakeholder confidence.
6-Month Check: Archive logs, verify version tags, and present a governance report to leadership.

️ Best Practices for Ongoing Value
Embed Early & Often: Bake privacy, security & fairness checks into your design sprints and retrospectives—don’t wait until rollout to think about governance.
Iterate & Monitor: Treat governance as a living process: regularly revisit policies, run fresh bias scans, and update guardrails as your agents evolve.
Empower Stakeholders: Define clear ownership—who approves, who reviews, and who acts on findings—and rotate a “Governance Champion” each quarter to lead reviews and training.
Automate Monitoring: Use tools (e.g., bias scanners, log aggregators) to surface issues before they become crises and feed them back into your sprint backlog.
Document & Share: Maintain a public “Governance Updates” changelog (in your repo or team wiki) so every change is visible and your team stays aligned.

 Quick Checklist for Self-Assessment

| ✔️ / ❌ | Item | 6-Month Action |
|---|---|---|
| | PII handling plan in place | Audit SOP; update for new data sources |
| | Human reviewer assigned | Confirm reviewer is active; rotate if needed |
| | Bias assessment scheduled | Run fresh bias audit; compare to baseline |
| | RBAC configured | Review permissions and rotate keys |
| | Logging & versioning enabled | Archive logs; tag new model/data versions |

Tip: Store this table in your repo’s root README so it’s the first thing anyone sees when they land on your project.
