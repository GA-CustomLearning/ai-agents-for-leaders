# AI Agents for Leaders Workshop

**Workshop Date & Location:** Ai4 Conference, Las Vegas — 2-hour session

## Workshop Objectives

*   Articulate the strategic value of agentic AI across revenue, cost, and risk.
*   Prototype AI-driven recommendations for individual organizational challenges.
*   Develop a concise pilot plan with governance guardrails and success metrics.

## Getting Started: Accessing Workshop Materials

We believe that understanding how AI projects are built and managed is crucial for leaders. This workshop uses GitHub, a platform widely used in software development, to organize and share our materials. Even if you're new to tech, engaging with GitHub will give you valuable insight into modern AI development workflows.

### Option 1: Browser-Based Access (Recommended for Most)

This is the easiest way to access all workshop materials without any local setup or software installation. You'll be able to view all files directly in your web browser.

1.  **Open the Workshop Repository:** Click on the link provided by your instructor (e.g., `https://github.com/your-org/ai4-agentic-workshop`).
2.  **Explore:** Navigate through the folders and files directly in your web browser. All lab instructions and templates are accessible this way.

### Option 2: Local Setup (For Those Who Want to Dive Deeper)

If you're curious about how developers manage code and want to experiment with the files on your own computer, you can set up the repository locally. This option requires basic command-line familiarity.

1.  **Install Git:** If you don't have it already, download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your computer's terminal or command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai4-agentic-workshop.git
    cd ai4-agentic-workshop
    ```
3.  **Explore Locally:** You can now open the `ai4-agentic-workshop` folder in your preferred text editor or file explorer.
