# AI Agents for Leaders Workshop

**Workshop Date & Location:** Ai4 Conference, Las Vegas — 2-hour session

## Workshop Objectives

*   Articulate the strategic value of agentic AI across revenue, cost, and risk.
*   Prototype AI-driven recommendations for individual organizational challenges.
*   Develop a concise pilot plan with governance guardrails and success metrics.

## Getting Started: Accessing Workshop Materials

We believe that understanding how AI projects are built and managed is crucial for leaders. This workshop uses GitHub, a platform widely used in software development, to organize and share our materials. Even if you're new to tech, engaging with GitHub will give you valuable insight into modern AI development workflows.

### Option 1: Browser-Based Access (Recommended for Most)

This is the easiest way to access all workshop materials without any local setup or software installation. You'll be able to view all files directly in your web browser.

1.  **Open the Workshop Repository:** Click on the link provided by your instructor (e.g., `https://github.com/GA-CustomLearning/ai-agents-for-leaders/`).
2.  **Explore:** Navigate through the folders and files directly in your web browser. All lab instructions and templates are accessible this way.

### Option 2: Local Setup (For Those Who Want to Dive Deeper)

If you're curious about how developers manage code and want to experiment with the files on your own computer, you can set up the repository locally. This option requires basic command-line familiarity.

1.  **Install Git:** If you don't have it already, download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your computer's terminal or command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GA-CustomLearning/ai-agents-for-leaders/
    cd ai4-agentic-workshop
    ```
3.  **Explore Locally:** You can now open the `ai4-agentic-workshop` folder in your preferred text editor or file explorer.

## Lab Instructions

1.  **Choose Your Priority**
    *   Revenue growth, cost optimization, or risk management.

2.  **Hands-On Prompting**
    *   Review [Module 03](Module/03.md) for context.
    *   Individually draft prompts in ChatGPT (or chosen AI tool) to generate **three actionable recommendations** for your selected priority.
    *   *Need inspiration?* See [Example AI Prompts](Resources/prompts/example-prompts.md).

3.  **Map to Metrics**
    *   Use `Resources/templates/metric-mapping-template.xlsx` to record impact metrics.
    *   *See an example:* [Completed Metric Mapping](Resources/templates/metric-mapping-example.md).

4.  **Refine & Pilot Plan**
    *   Open `Resources/templates/governance-checklist.md`.
    *   Add compliance or human-in-the-loop notes to your prompt designs.
    *   *See an example:* [Completed Governance Checklist](Resources/templates/governance-checklist-example.md).
    *   Draft a 1-page pilot outline: scope, timeline (next 2 weeks), owner, and success metric.
    *   *See an example:* [Completed Pilot Plan](Resources/plans/pilot-plan-example.md).

## Optional: Dive Deeper with GitHub Challenges

For those interested in exploring GitHub further, here are some low-stakes challenges to try. These are completely optional but can deepen your understanding of how AI projects are managed collaboratively.

*   **Make Your First Change:** If you've set up locally, open `Resources/plans/pilot-plan.md`, make a small edit (e.g., add your name as a stakeholder), and try to save your changes using Git (e.g., `git add .`, `git commit -m "My first change"`).
*   **Open an Issue:** Have a question about the workshop, or an idea for improvement? Go to the GitHub repository in your browser and click on the "Issues" tab to open a new issue.
*   **Explore the History:** On GitHub, navigate to any file (e.g., `PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md`) and click on the "History" button to see all the changes made over time. This is how teams track evolution of their projects.
